                This is a web application which will allow you to rank NY's districts according to several different
                factors of huge relevance in order to enjoy a pleasant stay at NY. <BR><BR>
                The <STRONG>factors</STRONG> in consideration are the following:
                <UL>
                    <LI> <EM>Safety</EM> - Measured by the number and severity of the crimes committed in a given
                         district in December 31st, 2015.</LI>
                    <LI> <EM>Affordability</EM> - Given by the number of low income units attributed to a given
                         district. Such number, by the way, means nothing but the amount of units with
                         rents that are affordable to households earning 51 to 80% of the area median
                         income. </LI>
                    <LI> <EM>Closeness</EM> - Taken as the distance of the district's centre to the NYU Stern School
                         of business.</LI>
                    <LI> <EM>Air quality</EM> - Determined as the result of pondering traffic density, related respiratory,
                         cardiovascular and asthma hospitalizations, deaths and ED (i.e. Emergency Department) visits,
                         and air contaminant substances emissions and concentrations.</LI>
                    <LI> <EM>Leisure</EM> - Quantified by pondering the number of farmer markets, nearby fishing rivers, child
                         care programs covering the district, authorized liquor expediters, museums and art galleries.</LI>
                    <LI> <EM>Transportation</EM> - Assessed by considering the number of subway stations, the typical usage
                         given to the public transportation system (public transportation services congestion) and
                         the particular vehicles operation intensity. </LI>
                </UL>
            The <STRONG>sources</STRONG> for the data involved in the computation of the previously mentioned indicators
            are accessible via the following links:<BR>

            The <STRONG>service</STRONG> will be provided in the following way:
            <UL>
                <LI> You count with the possibility to <U>obtain certain information related to every habitable district
                     of NY</U>. Such information is a valuation of the district for each of the previously listed factors
                     and their <EM>subfactors</EM> (i.e. The indicators summing up a factor, as described above for
                     each of the factors), plus a geographical reference to the district with respect to the other
                     districts (Google Maps). The valuations will be displayed both in a singular and comparative way,
                     so that it is possible to compare the district's habitability with that one of the other
                     districts. <BR>
                     All you have to do is to <U>enter the district of interest's name in the text box displayed right
                     after clicking on the "district search" option</U>, which lays in the navigation bar, at the
                     beginning of the page.</LI>
                <LI> For a faster access to potentially relevant information, you can <U>access the list of the most
                     habitable districts according to some criteria</U> (normally a single factor, sometimes even three).
                     The information displayed for each district will be the same as in the last item. <BR>
                     All what needs to be done to access this service is to <U>click on the option of interest right above,
                     in the navigation bar.</U></LI>
